## Specifications

**IMPORTANT:** Before implementing any feature, consult the specifications in `specs/OVERVIEW.md`.

- **Assume NOT implemented.** Many specs describe planned features that may not yet exist in the codebase.
- **Check the codebase first.** Before concluding something is or isn't implemented, search the actual code. Specs describe intent; code describes reality.
- **Use specs as guidance.** When implementing a feature, follow the design patterns, types, and architecture defined in the relevant spec.
