Need to experiment a little bit and see like literally ask the LLM which activities it considers productive, unproductive, or neutral

sprite swap per mood

Need the program to escalate? Essentially repeated infractions mean that messages get more stern. We want the average check to be 15 minutes but we also wanted to take into account the general flow. For example a user being unproductive for three or four intervals causes a higher level warning to appear

For the escalation overall we may switch from a points-based system to a spectrum where you have a value between 0 to 100. At 0 the waifu is happy and complimentary. At 50 she is neutral and somewhat pushing the user to get to work. At 100 she is furious. Then create a system that modifies the score

Need capability For the user to flag tasks as productive or unproductive.

### for the others

Implement some kind of waifu gacha system to ensnare the masses. Maybe even a leaderboard
