Need to experiment a little bit and see like literally ask the LLM which activities it considers productive, unproductive, or neutral

Need the waifu to sound like a waifu In her text

sprite swap per mood

Need the program to escalate? Essentially repeated infractions mean that messages get more stern. We want the average check to be 15 minutes but we also wanted to take into account the general flow. For example a user being unproductive for three or four intervals causes a higher level warning to appear

Need capability For the user to flag tasks as productive or unproductive.

I was on Twitter looking at this guy posting about a Chrome extension he made and it accidentally thought that was productive. So need more prompt engineering in that regard

### for the others

Implement some kind of waifu gatcha system to ensnare the masses. Maybe even a leaderboard
